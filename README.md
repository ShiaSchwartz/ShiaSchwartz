- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShiaSchwartz — Yes, the one and only, in case you were wondering.
- 👀 I’m interested in turning coffee into code, occasionally dabbling in machine learning, and contemplating why "dark mode" isn’t the default setting for every website.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to convince my computer to do my bidding without threatening to turn it off and on again. Also, Rust, because apparently, I like my programming languages to have a steep learning curve and a cool name.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me Send a carrier pigeon, smoke signals, LinkedIn works too, but only if you promise not to endorse me for "Microsoft Office".
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/Hey You
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once participated in a hackathon where my team and I built an app that did absolutely nothing — and it still wasn’t the worst project there. Also, I’m convinced that pet dogs has a better social life than I do.
